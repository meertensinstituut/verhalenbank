# verhalenbank

This is a docker setup for verhalenbank

 * `web` contains the website of verhalenbank
 * `db` contains the database (content and corresponding table should be created manually)
 * `solr` is commented out, as not needed during dev. This HAS to be set manually on the production server

all the contents in folder `html/files` are not included in the repo. These are too big and ever changing. Please copy 
from production server.
